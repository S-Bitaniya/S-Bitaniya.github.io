     <h1>What is the Influenza?</h1>

    <p> Welcome to the backgroud page! Here is where we will share how the the influena has impacted California. California is one of the many places around the wolrd that is greatly impacted by the flu. Commonly mistaken for the cold,the flu is a viral infection that affects the respiratory system. The flu can be a very serious illness,especially if not prevented against or treated early on. The disease caused by the virus influenza thrives in cold and dry climates which exist in California. The influenza virus has the ability to mutate,and therefore has different types or strains: A B C and D. Types A and B causes symptoms in humans, A being more severe. Symptoms include fever or chills,sore throat,runny nose,fatigue,headaches,and muscle soreness. In these strains, more varieties of the virus can exist. Because of this, vaccines and antiviral drugs  become less effective ( influenza can mutate faster than scientists can create new vaccines). Although vaccines have negative aspects, they are the most effective way to protect yourself from the flu. Viruses cannot be cured, but can be prevented against with vaccines. Over the course of five weeks, our group was tasked with utilizing the 5 design thinking steps (empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test)in order to create a solution to a specific problem such as an infectious disease. In our case, we chose Influenza as our main focus. Our goal was to find what problems surrounded this common virus and find a way to solve them. Throughout the project we used empathy to understand how people may feel. Furthermore, we interviewed various people in public settings in order to diversify our responses. We also interacted with professionals that worked on the influenza virus so as to receive a different perspectives. We discovered that students on the Berkeley campus didn't regard the flu as a threat. This was one of the main reasons they chose to be unvaccinated. However, we found this to be a problem because the flu can be potentially dangerous.
