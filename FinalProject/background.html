    <p> Welcome to the backgroud page! Here is where we will share how the the influena has impacted California. California is one of the many places around the wolrd that is greatly impacted by the flu. Commonly mistaken for the cold,the flu is a viral infection that affects the respiratory system. The flu can be a very serious illness,especially if not prevented against or treated early on. The disease caused by the virus influenza thrives in cold and dry climates which exist in California. The influenza virus has the ability to mutate,and therefore has different types or strains: A B C and D. Types A and B causes symptoms in humans, A being more severe. Symptoms include fever or chills,sore throat,runny nose,fatigue,headaches,and muscle soreness. In these strains, more varieties of the virus can exist. Because of this, vaccines and antiviral drugs  become less effective ( influenza can mutate faster than scientists can create new vaccines). Although vaccines have negative aspects, they are the most effective way to protect yourself from the flu. Viruses cannot be cured, but can be prevented against with vaccines.  </p>
