                    <h2>Why?</h2>
                    <p>The flu is a serious illness and with proper and early prevention can reduce the risk of its severity. Other products that try to limit barriers to vaccination create new barriers themselves. Nasal flu vaccinations aren’t available to many groups of individuals that are more susceptible to disease and microneedle patches increase the risk of side effects on the user. Our product is make flu vaccination quick,easy,and painless. </p>

                    <p>Modern vaccination manufacturing contributes to pollution. Quick vax wants happy people and a happy environment too. We plan to create artificial antigens instead of using chicken eggs in the process,we will use biodegradable plastic in our products,and will not use thimerosal, a chemical used in current vaccines.
