      <p> Welcome to our Project page! Over the course of five weeks, our group was tasked with utilizing the 5 design thinking steps in order to create a solution to a specific problem such as an infectious disease. In our case, we chose Influenza as our main focous. Our goal was to find what problems surrounded this common virus and find a way to solve them. Throughout the project we used empathy to understnad how people may feel. Furthermore, we interviewed various people in public settings in order to diversify our responses.
