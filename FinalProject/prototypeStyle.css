    content:"Welcome to our Project page! Over the course of five weeks, our group was tasked with utilizing the 5 design thinking steps (empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test)in order to create a solution to a specific problem such as an infectious disease. In our case, we chose Influenza as our main focous. Our goal was to find what problems surrounded this common virus and find a way to solve them. Throughout the project we used empathy to understnad how people may feel. Furthermore, we interviewed various people in public settings in order to diversify our responses. We also interacted with proffessionals that worked on the influenza virus so as to recieve a different perspectives. We discovered that students on the Berkeley campus didnt regard the flu as a threat. This was one of the main resons they chose to be unvaccinated. However, we found this to be a problem because the flu cam be potentially dangerous."
